# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction üéâ

Hello world! - here with the jokes - Here lies a piece of art that even Picasso would envy - a JavaScript-based Command-Line Application known as "Rock Paper Scissors". Sounds simple? It's way more than that! Here, the quintessential children's game meets the beauty of JavaScript created by moi.

My application loads its magic as soon as your HTML does. No installations, no gimmicks. Just old-school Rock Paper Scissors. You type a hand to play, your computer randomly selected theirs, and voil√†! The stage is set for an epic showdown. The program, in all its omniscient glory, declares the winner or calls it a tie. Be warned though, your computer doesn't like losing.

## Installation Instructions üìö

Well, here comes the complicated part. Please, brace yourself and read carefully:

1. Absolutely no installation is required to use this program. 

Yes, you read it right. None, nada, zilch! Your computer won't groan under the weight of another application. Isn't that simply delightful? Now breathe out!

## Usage Instructions üéÆ

1. Load the HTML.
2. You'll see a prompt to choose your weapon - Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Make your decision wisely, warrior!
3. The computer, in its infinite wisdom, will also make a choice.
4. Wait for the moment of truth. The program will announce who has bragging rights, or if you both need to go back to strategy school.
5. Rinse and repeat. Hours of fun, right at your fingertips!

Now, remember, the game has no mercy. It's a dog eat dog world in Rock Paper Scissors. Don't come crying if you lose to a hunk of silicon and wires!

## Contribution Guidelines ü§ù

Do you have an itch to make my beautifully simple game even more beautiful? Perhaps a dash of color here, a new feature there? I'm all ears!

I like my code like I like my jokes - clean and witty. So, if you've got something to add, don't be shy. Here's how:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazingFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Acknowledgements üôè

Huge thanks to The Odin Project creators for not only teaching us web development but also how to enjoy it. Without their guidance and resources, we'd probably be stuck playing this in the real world with other humans - yuck!

Remember, winning isn't everything. Except when you're playing Rock Paper Scissors against a computer - then it's a matter of human pride. Good luck!
